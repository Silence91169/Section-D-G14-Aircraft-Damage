# Problem Statement

Wildlife strikes are a recurring safety and operational issue in aviation. Although many strikes do not result in damage, a significant number lead to aircraft damage, engine ingestion, operational delays, and high maintenance costs.

The absence of clarity regarding which operational, environmental, and biological conditions increase damage probability limits effective prevention and resource allocation.

This project analyzes historical wildlife strike data to identify high-risk conditions that significantly elevate aircraft damage risk.

# Project Approach

- Data cleaning and transformation in Google Sheets  
- KPI framework development  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Dashboard visualization  
- Insight extraction and recommendation mapping  

---

# Dataset Overview

**Source:** Kaggle – *Aircraft Wildlife Strikes (1990–2015)*  
**Original Source:** FAA Wildlife Strike Database  

**Records:** 9,999  
**Variables:** 24  

Each row represents one wildlife strike incident.

---

# Key Columns Used

- Incident Year / Month / Day  
- Airport  
- FAA Region  
- Flight Phase  
- Height  
- Speed  
- Species Name  
- Species Quantity  
- Aircraft Damage  
- Engine Ingested  
- Flight Impact  
- Visibility  
- Precipitation  

---

# Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Standardized categorical values (YES / NO / UNKNOWN)
- Replaced missing categorical fields with "UNKNOWN"
- Treated blank numeric values as 0
- Created:
  - Height Bands
  - Speed Bands
- Normalized text formatting
- No outliers removed (rare events retained for safety relevance)

All processing was done in **Google Sheets**.

# KPI Framework

| KPI | Formula | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|
| Damage Rate | Damage ÷ Total Incidents | Measures strike severity |
| Engine Ingestion Rate | Engine Ingested ÷ Total Incidents | Identifies high-severity events |
| Seasonal Risk Index | Monthly Incidents ÷ Annual Average | Detects peak months |
| Phase Risk Index | Damage by Phase ÷ Total Damage | Identifies vulnerable flight phases |

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Monthly Strike Trend

![Monthly Trend](Documentation/Images/img4.png)

- Clear seasonal spike from July–October
- September records highest incidents (1,490)

---

## 2. Aircraft Damage by Flight Phase

![Flight Phase Damage](Documentation/Images/img5.png)

Highest damage incidents:
- Approach (469)
- Climb (309)
- Takeoff Run (286)

However, **EN ROUTE shows highest damage probability (20.38%)**.

---

## 3. Annual Incident Trend (1990–1993)

![Annual Trend](Documentation/Images/img6.png)

- Increasing trend from 1990
- Peak in 1992 (2,816 incidents)
- Slight decline in 1993

---

# Key Insights

- Approach and Takeoff phases are most damage-prone operational stages.
- Wildlife strikes show strong seasonality, peaking in September.
- Engine ingestion significantly increases severity.
- Snow conditions amplify damage risk.
- Damage probability is driven more by operational context than strike frequency.
- Certain airports and FAA regions show concentrated exposure.
- Multi-animal strikes increase severity probability.
- Unknown Medium Bird contributes disproportionately to ingestion events.

# Recommendations

| Recommendation | Impact |
|----------------|--------|
| Enhanced wildlife monitoring during approach & takeoff | High |
| Seasonal risk alerts (Aug–Oct) | High |
| Strengthen engine inspection protocols | High |
| Snow-weather advisories | Medium |
| Targeted bird control at hotspot airports | High |
| Species-specific mitigation programs | Medium |
| Low-altitude surveillance enhancement | Medium |
| Dashboard-driven proactive monitoring | High |

# Expected Impact

### Cost Savings
- 8–12% reduction in damage incidents

### Operational Efficiency
- Fewer precautionary landings
- Reduced delays

### Risk Reduction
- Lower engine ingestion severity
- Improved seasonal preparedness

---

# Limitations

- No flight traffic normalization data
- Missing environmental details
- No financial cost linkage
- Correlation-based insights (not causal)
- Historical data only (no real-time prediction)

---

# Future Scope

- Predictive modeling
- Airport Risk Index
- Severity scoring system
- Cost impact modeling
- Real-time dashboard integration
- AI-driven risk alerts

---

# Dashboard Objective

The dashboard enables:

- Trend monitoring
- Phase risk identification
- Seasonal risk analysis
- Engine vulnerability evaluation
- Airport-level exposure assessment

---

# Conclusion

This project successfully transformed wildlife strike data into actionable aviation safety insights through structured cleaning, KPI development, exploratory analysis, and dashboard visualization.

The analysis identifies flight phase, engine ingestion, seasonal migration, weather conditions, and species concentration as primary risk drivers.

The framework supports proactive mitigation and can be extended using predictive analytics.
