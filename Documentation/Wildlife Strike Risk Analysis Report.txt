Problem
Wildlife strikes represent a growing safety and operational risk in the aviation industry, leading to aircraft damage, flight delays, precautionary landings, and increased maintenance costs. This project analyzes historical wildlife strike incident data to identify temporal trends, high-risk locations, flight phases, species involvement, damage patterns, and environmental factors contributing to strike severity
Approach
 
A data-driven analysis was conducted using historical wildlife strike incident data. Data cleaning and standardization were performed in Google Sheets as per capstone guidelines. Pivot tables were used to analyze trends, high-risk locations, flight phases, species impact, damage patterns, and environmental factors. The results were consolidated into an interactive dashboard with filters and drill-downs to support clear visualization and informed decision-making.
Key Insights 
 
Wildlife strike incidents show an increasing trend with clear seasonal variation. Most strikes occur during takeoff and landing, with takeoff posing higher engine damage risk. A small number of airports and regions account for a large share of incidents. Engine strikes cause the most severe aircraft damage and operational disruption. Certain species, low visibility, adverse weather, and low-altitude operations significantly increase strike severity.
Key Recommendations
 
Implement targeted wildlife management at high-risk airports and during peak seasons. Strengthen runway-level monitoring, especially during takeoff and landing. Prioritize engine protection and inspection protocols to reduce severe damage. Use weather-based alerts and dashboard-driven monitoring for proactive, data-informed risk mitigation.
Sector Overview
The aviation sector prioritizes passenger safety, aircraft integrity, and operational reliability. Wildlife strikes threaten all three by causing physical damage, flight disruptions, and financial losses. 
Current Challenges
* Rising air traffic volumes

* Expanding airport footprints near wildlife habitats

* Increasing bird populations near runways

* Limited real-time risk visibility

Why This Problem Was Chosen
Wildlife strike data is widely available but underutilized for strategic decision-making. This project bridges that gap by transforming raw incident data into actionable insights.

Problem Statement
Airports and airlines lack an integrated analytical view to understand where, when, and why wildlife strikes cause maximum risk and damage.


Project Scope        
   * Historical analysis of wildlife strike incidents

   * Focus on trends, risk concentration, and damage severity

   * Dashboard-driven insights for aviation stakeholders

Success Criteria
      * Clear identification of high-risk periods, locations, and conditions

      * Practical insights aligned with operational decision-making

      * Interactive dashboard usability
Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, titled “Aircraft Wildlife Strikes, 1990–2015”. The dataset is derived from the FAA Wildlife Strike Database and contains reported wildlife strike incidents involving civil aircraft in the United States during the period 1990 to 2015.
Data Structure
The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where each row represents a single aircraft wildlife strike incident. The columns capture multiple aspects of each incident, including time of occurrence, airport and regional information, flight operational details, species involved, aircraft damage outcomes, and environmental conditions present during the strike.
The dataset includes both categorical variables (such as flight phase, aircraft damage, species name, FAA region, and weather conditions) and numerical variables (such as incident year, height, speed, and species quantity). This structured design enables efficient aggregation, filtering, and analysis using pivot tables and dashboards.


Key Columns Used
         * Incident Year / Month / Day: Date components indicating when the wildlife strike occurred

         * Airport: Name of the airport where the incident took place

         * Airport ID: Unique identifier assigned to each airport

         * State: State in which the airport is located

         * FAA Region: FAA administrative region of the airport

         * Flight Phase: Phase of flight during which the strike occurred (e.g., takeoff, climb, landing)

         * Height: Aircraft altitude at the time of the strike

         * Speed: Aircraft speed during the incident

         * Species Name: Identified wildlife species involved in the strike

         * Species Quantity: Number or estimated range of animals involved

         * Aircraft Damage: Indicates whether the aircraft sustained damage

         * Engine Ingested: Indicates whether wildlife was ingested into the engine

         * Engine Damage: Indicates whether engine damage occurred

         * Flight Impact: Operational impact such as precautionary landing or aborted takeoff

         * Visibility: Visibility conditions at the time of the incident

         * Precipitation: Weather condition during the strike

         * Engine, Wing, Windshield, and Fuselage Strike Indicators: Identify which aircraft parts were struck
Data Size
The dataset contains 10,000 records (rows) and 24 variables (columns). Each record corresponds to an individual wildlife strike incident reported within the aviation sector over multiple years.


Data Limitations
            * Some records contain missing or incomplete values, particularly for species identification and environmental conditions.

            * Earlier years may suffer from under-reporting or inconsistent reporting standards.

            * Damage severity and species quantity are sometimes reported in ranges or qualitative terms, limiting precise quantification.

            * The dataset focuses on reported incidents only and may not capture all wildlife strikes.
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Data cleaning and preparation were critical to ensure the reliability and analytical usability of the wildlife strike dataset. The raw FAA wildlife strike data contained missing values, inconsistent formats, categorical encodings, and multiple binary indicators. All cleaning and transformation activities were performed exclusively in Google Sheets, in accordance with the capstone project requirements.
________________


Missing Values Handling
The raw dataset contained a significant number of missing and blank values across multiple fields such as aircraft characteristics, environmental conditions, altitude, speed, and species identification.
               * Categorical fields with missing values (e.g., Species Name, Flight Phase, Visibility, Precipitation) were retained and treated as “Unknown” where appropriate to avoid loss of incident records.

               * Numerical fields such as Height, Speed, and Distance contained blanks or zero values. These were preserved as missing when not explicitly reported rather than imputed, to prevent introducing artificial bias.

               * Records with missing critical identifiers (e.g., Incident Year, Airport, Flight Phase) were retained only when they did not affect high-level trend or pivot-based analysis.

________________


 Outlier Treatment
Outliers were examined primarily in numerical variables such as height, speed, and distance.
                  * Extreme values were evaluated for plausibility based on aviation context.

                  * No aggressive removal of outliers was performed, as many high-altitude or high-speed values are operationally valid.

                  * Instead of deletion, outliers were handled analytically through pivot tables and categorical grouping, minimizing distortion in trend analysis.

________________


 Data Transformations
Several transformations were applied to standardize the dataset and support dashboard-based analysis:
                     * Date components (Incident Year, Month, Day) were retained separately to enable time-series and seasonal analysis.

                     * Binary indicator columns (e.g., Engine Damage, Windshield Strike, Fuselage Damage) were standardized to consistent 0/1 values.

                     * Species Quantity ranges (e.g., 1, 2–10, 11–100) were treated as categorical variables rather than numeric values.

                     * Text fields with inconsistent capitalization or formatting were standardized for uniform pivot aggregation.

________________


Feature Engineering
To enhance analytical depth, additional derived features were created from existing columns:
                        * Damage Severity Indicators were inferred from combinations of Aircraft Damage, Engine Damage, and Engine Ingested fields.

                        * Operational Risk Groupings were derived using Flight Phase and Altitude to highlight critical risk windows.

                        * Seasonal patterns were analyzed using Month-level aggregation.

                        * Airport and regional risk profiles were developed using Airport, State, and FAA Region groupings.

These engineered features enabled effective risk-based segmentation within pivot dashboards.
________________


Assumptions
The following assumptions were applied during data preparation:
                           * Missing environmental or species information implies non-reporting, not absence.

                           * Zero values in altitude or speed represent ground-level or unreported measurements, not invalid data.

                           * Binary strike indicators accurately reflect reported outcomes, even when multiple components were struck in a single incident.

                           * The cleaned dataset is assumed to be representative of reported wildlife strike events, acknowledging potential underreporting.

________________
 Tools and Execution Environment
All primary data cleaning, transformation, and feature preparation steps were conducted using Google Sheets, including filtering, conditional formatting, pivot table creation, and derived field calculations. No external programming tools or databases were used, ensuring full compliance with capstone project guidelines.

Insights Summary (Decision-Oriented)
                                                                        1. Approach and Takeoff Run phases represent the highest operational risk, accounting for the majority of damage incidents.

                                                                        2. Wildlife strike incidents follow a strong seasonal pattern, with peak activity between July and October, and the highest concentration in September.

                                                                        3. Annual incident counts show an increasing trend, peaking in 1992, indicating growing exposure to wildlife risks.

                                                                        4. Engine ingestion events significantly increase damage severity, often leading to precautionary landings or aborted takeoffs.

                                                                        5. Snow and adverse weather conditions amplify aircraft damage risk, particularly during low-altitude operations.

                                                                        6. Low and medium altitude bands experience the highest strike frequency, aligning with critical flight phases near airports.

                                                                        7. A small subset of species (notably “Unknown Medium Bird”) contributes disproportionately to ingestion events, indicating targeted wildlife threats.

                                                                        8. Certain FAA regions and airports show concentrated strike exposure, suggesting localized risk hotspots rather than uniform distribution.

                                                                        9. Most incidents involve single animals, but multi-animal strikes have a higher probability of severe damage.

                                                                        10. Damage patterns are driven more by operational context than sheer strike frequency, emphasizing the importance of phase- and condition-specific controls.

These insights directly support targeted risk mitigation rather than broad, non-specific safety measures.

                                                                                       * Some fields contain missing or generalized values that required assumptions.

Assumption Risks
                                                                                          * Trend-based forecasting assumes consistency in reporting and operational conditions.

                                                                                          * Impact estimates assume mitigation measures are correctly implemented and followed.

What Cannot Be Concluded
                                                                                             * Exact financial cost per incident cannot be calculated due to absence of cost data.

                                                                                             * Causal relationships cannot be statistically proven; insights are correlation-based.

                                                                                             * Real-time risk prediction is not possible with historical data alone.

Conclusion
This project successfully delivers a structured, data-driven analysis of wildlife strike risks in aviation operations using historical FAA data. By leveraging Google Sheets, pivot tables, and interactive dashboards, the study identifies critical risk drivers such as flight phase vulnerability, seasonal trends, environmental conditions, engine ingestion severity, and regional exposure.
The insights generated support targeted mitigation strategies rather than generalized safety measures, enabling improved operational planning, reduced damage risk, and enhanced aviation safety. Despite data limitations, the project demonstrates strong analytical value and provides a scalable foundation for advanced predictive and real-time risk management solutions.
